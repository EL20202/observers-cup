- point scaling (get others to test)

future list:
- add rewards for completion (possibly custom weapons? :eyes:)
  - broken gauntlet -> 
  - broken shield -> unwavering aegis [high defense and resistances]
  - broken sword -> 
  - broken deck -> trickster's cards [likely focus/status rush/sp regen... probably would be a little OP]
  - broken chakrams -> 

solved:
- figure out why it autosaves in the pandza fight (previous map had saving enabled)
- fix ghost shark level (patchsteps ftw)
