- point scaling (get others to test)

future list:
- add rewards for completion (possibly custom weapons? :eyes:)
  - broken gauntlet -> restored gauntlet -> ???
  - broken shield -> restored shield -> unwavering aegis [high defense and resistances]
  - broken sword -> restored sword -> grandmaster's blade [name likely to change]
  - broken deck -> restored deck -> trickster's suits [likely focus/status rush/sp regen... probably would be a little OP]
  - broken chakrams -> restored chakrams -> ???

solved:
- figure out why it autosaves in the pandza fight (previous map had saving enabled)
- fix ghost shark level (patchsteps ftw)
